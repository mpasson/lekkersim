# LekkerSIM package

LekkerSIM is a open source package for linear simulation of photonic circuit, based on the well known scattering matrix method.
Its features include:
- Easy calculation of S-parameters of a photonic circuit;
- A collection of pre-defined building blocks for easy definition of circuits;
- Parametric building blocks;
- Hierarchical circuit definition;
- Monitors inside the circuit for calculation of power flow.

## Installation
You can install LekkerSIM directly from pypi by running:

    pip install lekkersim

## Documentation
